*************************
RETRIEVING THE ACCEL DATA
*************************
To compile the get_accel_data function, you must alter compile.m with the
absolute location of the libFreenect include directory. Once compile,
get_accel_data.mex* can be called to extract the accelerometer data from the 
*.a files in each scene dump directory.
