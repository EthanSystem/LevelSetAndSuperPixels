You need to download the SMIL library first at: " http://smil.cmm.mines-paristech.fr/doc/index.html ".

To run the program (m-waterpixels, square cells) with ipython:

       run demo_waterpixels_smil_with_parser.py -i "montagne.jpg" -s 25 -w 10 --filter_ori      ## filtering of the original image
or     run demo_waterpixels_smil_with_parser.py -i "montagne.jpg" -s 25 -w 10 --no-filter_ori   ## no filtering of the original image

where:
- "i" is the original image you would like to partition into waterpixels;
- "s" is the grid step (int);
- "w" is the weight of the distance function for regularization (float).

Note that this program has only been tested under Linux. Not all optimizations are implemented in this public version.
