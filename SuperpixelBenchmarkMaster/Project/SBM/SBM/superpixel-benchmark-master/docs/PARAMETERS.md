# Parameters

Parts of the considered parameters for all algorithms can be found in `eval_parameter_optimization_cli/main.cpp`.
Note that this only represents the last step of parameter optimization.
The actually evaluated parameters will be made available as far as possible.

Additional notes and comments on the used parameters can be found in `PARAMETERS.txt`.
**Note that these comments are unordered logs of all conducted experiments that 
cannot replace a thorough discussion!** Therefore, the presented parameters and notes should
be considered with some care.
