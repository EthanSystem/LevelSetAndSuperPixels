# Example of using and evaluating SEEDS on the BSDS500.
# Supposed to be run from within examples/.

# ../bin/seeds_cli is the command line tool for SEEDS.
# ../bin/eval_summary_cli takes the generated superpixel labels as CSV, the original
# images and ground truths as CSV to evaluate the superpixels.
# ../bin/eval_visualization_cli takes the generated superpixel labels as CSV, the
# original images and creates the specified visualizations (i.e. --contours).
